# Mental Health Prediction Model using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
This project presents a machine learning model designed to predict individuals' mental health status using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The model is trained on a dataset of Canadian adults' mental health information and aims to identify patterns and correlations that can be indicative of mental health conditions.
