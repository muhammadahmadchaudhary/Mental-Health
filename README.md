# Mental Health Prediction Model using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
This project presents a machine learning model designed to predict individuals' mental health status using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The model is trained on a dataset of Canadian adults' mental health information and aims to identify patterns and correlations that can be indicative of mental health conditions.

# Key Features:
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Architecture: Utilizes a feedforward neural network with multiple layers to enhance predictive accuracy.
K-Fold Cross-Validation: Ensures robust model evaluation and generalization by partitioning the dataset into training and validation subsets.
Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for cleaning, normalizing, and preparing the dataset for effective model training.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Project Components:
Data Collection: Details on the dataset used, including its source and relevant features.
Model Design: Explanation of the MLP architecture, including the number of layers and activation functions used.
Training Process: Insights into the training procedure, including hyperparameter tuning and optimization techniques.
Evaluation: Results and analysis of the modelâ€™s performance on the test data, with visualizations and comparison to baseline methods.
Deployment: Instructions for deploying the model and integrating it into applications for mental health prediction.
